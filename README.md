# Note:
Please create APIs and use them for intigration.
## Introduction 📖
Our goal is to develop a **Database Backup and Recovery System** using PHP and the Symfony framework. This system will feature a web interface for users and an admin panel for administrators to manage user data and perform database backups and recoveries.

## Key Features 🔑

### User Management 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Users can register and their information (name, email, profile) will be stored in the database.
- A web interface will display a list of registered users with their names and profiles.
- Validation for adding new users via a form, including fields for name, email, and profile.

### Admin Panel 🛠️
- Administrators can access an admin panel to manage user data.
- Allows administrators to delete users.
- Displays user information including name, email, and profile.

### Database Backup 📦
- An API will enable the admin to take a backup of the database at any given time.
- The backup file generated will be of type 'backup.sql'.

### Database Recovery 🔧
- An API will allow the admin to push a backup file to the database for recovery purposes.
